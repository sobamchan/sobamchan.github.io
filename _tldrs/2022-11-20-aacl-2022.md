  - Ilia Kulikov, Maksim Eremeev, Kyunghyun Cho
  - **TLDR**: We propose to explicitly minimize the oversmoothing rate of neural machine translation models and show that this is the main reason behind the degenerate case of overly probable short sequences in a neural autoregressive model.

- [Identifying Weaknesses in Machine Translation Metrics Through Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding: A Case Study for COMET](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.83)
  - Chantal Amrhein, Rico Sennrich
  - **TLDR**: We show that neural metrics in machine translation systems are not sensitive enough to discrepancies in numbers and named entities.

- [Whodunit? Learning to Contrast for Authorship Attribution](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.84)
  - Bo Ai, Yuchen Wang, Yugin Tan, Samson Tan
  - **TLDR**: We propose to learn author-specific language representations by fine-tuning pre-trained generic language representations with a contrastive objective (Contra-X).

- [Higher-Order Dependency Parsing for Arc-Polynomial Score Functions via Gradient-Based Methods and Genetic Algorithm](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.85)
  - Xudong Zhang, Joseph Le Roux, Thierry Charnois
  - **TLDR**: We present a novel method for higher-order dependency parsing which takes advantage of the general form of score functions written as arc-polynomials, a general framework which encompasses common higher- order score functions, and includes new ones.

- [Underspecification in Scene Description-to-Depiction Tasks](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.86)
  - Ben Hutchinson, Jason Baldridge, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran
  - **TLDR**: We present a conceptual framework for addressing the ambiguity and underpredictability of multimodal image+text systems, and propose strategies for addressing these challenges.

- [COFAR: Commonsense and Factual Reasoning in Image Search](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.87)
  - Prajwal Gatti, Abhirama Subramanyam Penamakuri, Revant Teotia, Anand Mishra, Shubhashis Sengupta, Roshni Ramnani
  - **TLDR**: We present a unified framework for commonsense and factual reasoning in image search that leverages visual content and grounded knowledge to learn alignment between images and search queries.
