Hello, I am Sotaro Takeshita. I will soon will be Ph.D. student studying natual language processing (NLP).
I am interested in 

- multilingual models
- information extraction
- knowledge utilization for NLP models

I like to read (both papers and books) and programming checkout my [OSS projects](https://github.com/sobamchan).
I speak Japanese (native), English (fluent), Spanish (basic) and now learning German.
As computer languages, I like to use vim to write python.
Feel free to get in touch by email (oh.sore.sore.soutarou at gmail.com).
