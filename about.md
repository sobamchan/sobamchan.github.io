Hello, I am Sotaro Takeshita. I am a second-year Ph.D. student at University of Mannheim focusing on text summarization.
I am interested in

- analyzing text embeddings
- text summarization
- scholarly document processing

I like to read (both papers and books) and programming checkout [my paper search system](https://gengo.sotaro.io) and its [extension with an LLM](https://gengo-chat.sotaro.io), as well as my [OSS projects](https://github.com/sobamchan).
I speak Japanese (native), English (fluent), Spanish (basic) and now learning German.
For programming, I like to use (neo)vim to write python.
Feel free to get in touch by email (oh.sore.sore.soutarou at gmail.com).
