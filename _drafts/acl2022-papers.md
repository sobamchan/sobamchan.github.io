- [Generating Scientific Definitions with Controllable Complexity](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.569)
  - **Problem**: Scientific terms can be hard to understand for readers and definitions in general purpose dictionaries often don't contain them.
  - **Approach**: Collected pairs of a question about a scientifiv term and an answer from various sources and performed benchmark experiments with existing models.

- [When to Use Multi-Task Learning vs Intermediate Fine-Tuning for Pre-Trained Encoder Transfer Learning](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-short.30)
  - **Problem**: It's not clear yet which transfer learning strategy to take.
  - **Approach**: Compared multitask learning and intermediate fine-tuning on GLUE benchmark and found that multitask learning is better than intermediate fine-tuning when the target task has fewer samples than the supporting task (vice versa).
