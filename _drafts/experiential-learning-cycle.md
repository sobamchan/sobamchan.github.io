Leaning is essential part of our lives.
It is of course important for a student like me too, basically it is the main purpose of being a student.
While I was in a grad school studying computer science, I saw few students, outstanding from others in various ways, programming, math, physics, etc...
It's not like they are way smarter than the others, but they have obtained such skills make them distinguished.
How does it happen?
When we entered to the school, everyone took the same extrance exam, we all started from (almost) the same point,
but the end of the day, there is such a huge gap.

Since I have found out about this difference between students, as a non outstanding student, I had to find out what the key is,
there must be some secrets that only cool students know.
It's been four month since my graduation, I still don't know what they are, but I have encountered one idea/framework which was proposed by
an American educational theorist 40 years ago.
The researcher is [David Allen Kolb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Kolb),
and the framework is called ["Kolb's experiential learning"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolb%27s_experiential_learning)


<!--Public universities in Japan require entrance exam, and all high-school who are applying to the same school take the same exam.-->
<!--Therefore, besides few exception, so there are not "that" huge difference-->
