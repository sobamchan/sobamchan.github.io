On this blog, initially, I wanted to write something about my research interests, natural language processing.
However, for some reason, it's intimidating to start with that topic.
So, to warm this place up, let me write about one art of natural language, haiku - super short Japanese poetry.

[Haiku (俳句)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) is a traditional form of poetry in Japan, which is composed of three phrases.
First and last phrase have five syllables and the middle one has seven, which make its rhythm sounds very comfortable to our ears.
One more characteristic of haiku is that they consist at least one kigo (季語), a word relates to seasons such as snow, pool or autumn leaves etc...

Given this very basic of haiku, let's take a look at some of well known ones in Japan.
(I will do my best to translate but this is very hard.)
