On this blog, initially, I wanted to write something about my research interests, natural language processing.
However, for some reason, it's intimidating to start with that topic.
So, to warm this place up, let me write about one art of natural language, haiku - super short Japanese poetry.

[Haiku (俳句)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) is a traditional form of poetry in Japan, which is composed of three phrases.
First and last phrase have five syllables and the middle one has seven, which make its rhythm sounds very comfortable to our ears.
One more characteristic of haiku is that they consist at least one kigo (季語), a word relates to seasons such as snow, pool or autumn leaves etc...

The history of haiku dates back to 16th century, muromachi-era, age of samurais (Japanese warrior).
There was a bit longer version of poet called renka (連歌) which highly academical so not for everyone, given this background haiku has emerged and accepted by society.
In 17th century, one of the most well known haiku-author, Basho Matsuo (松尾芭蕉), starts to make his name.
He wrote a travelogue everyone know, Oku-no-hosomichi (奥の細道), means "a narrow path in the back".
It must have been an amazing journey, visiting romantic places in 150-days, stopping at each place to write a haiku describing things that moved him.
Let me quote one haiku he wrote when he visited Hiraizumi (平泉) where a very strong family used to rule long time before Basho went.

「夏草や 兵どもが 夢の跡」

This describes the fragility of the place where used to be a battlefield warriors fought for life, but at the time of visit, he could only see summer grass, everything is just like a dream.
Our lives we think are great and glorious, but over time, after you pass there won't be anything but the summer grass which overwrite everything.
However, even they are very temporary, this haiku shows that how people try to live up their lives is beatutiful.
I wish I could have written English better but I don't think I can describe the meaning even in my native language anyway.

Given this very basic of haiku, let's take a look at some of well known ones in Japan.
(I will do my best to translate but this is very hard.)
