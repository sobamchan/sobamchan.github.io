I don't know if my first post on this domain can be this title, sure, I wanted to write about something cooler,
but I don't have such things.
Yet purpose to write posts here is practicing my English, so it's just fine.

I graduated from the university in this spring where I spent my last 7 years.
Most of university students in Japan finish their job hunting during the semester,
this means that all my friends are now in companies working 5 days in a week.

However I didn't do that like everyone else did, because I chose to do PhD.
Yes, many people in Japan who seek for PhD start right after they graduate from masters,
but since the university for me to do it is located at Europe, where semeters start at autumn.
I got a half year gap.
