> What made you choose your host institution/host university?

My research interests match well to theirs, and their significant contributions to the field and attitude to make research reproducible made me want to pursue working in the team.


> Short description of research/study/work project

One application of deep learning on natural language processing (NLP) is universal language understanding models. Models can perform well on various NLP tasks such as question and answering, yet its lack of commonsense often cause to yield misleading outputs. Since it is known to be challenging to find commonsense resources only in text data, my project proposes to utilize visual data instead.

> What other extracurricular activities/interests would you like to mention?

One of my side activities is software development. I developed many software applications and tools. For instance, I built an English learning app in which users can study English with music. This uses the latest deep learning model behind, and it has been used by more than a hundred people.

- ML の社会実装の経験，job 5y, interns (univ, company)，side project
- 研究室訪問して内容を先生と詰めているのですぐ開始する事ができる
- 大学で文化交流していた経験

分野のテクノロージーが社会でどのように利用されているかを知っている．
自分の研究分野のテクノロジーを産業界で実装してきた経験がある．

仕事やインターンシップで実際に実装を行うことで，自分の研究分野の技術が社会でどのように利用されているのか知っている

仕事やインターンシップで研究分野のテクノロジーを実際に利用してきた経験があるので，

I know how the technologies in my field of interests are utilized in society because I have experiences implementing state of the art systems in various applications at jobs and internships.
These experiences will be helpful during my doctorate course since the interests from industry in AI technologies increases year after year, and researchers are required to focus on human more.
My proposal topic is one approach to make safe AI systems for people, so having experience in this side of the research is a strong point.
