> Short description of research/study/work project

One application of deep learning on natural language processing (NLP) is universal language understanding models. Models can perform well on various NLP tasks such as question and answering, yet its lack of commonsense often cause to yield misleading outputs. Since it is known to be challenging to find commonsense resources only in text data, my project proposes to utilize visual data instead.

> What other extracurricular activities/interests would you like to mention?

One of my side activities is software development. I developed many web / mobile applications and tools. For instance, I built an English learning app in which users can study English with music. This uses the latest deep learning model behind, and it has been used by more than a hundred people.
