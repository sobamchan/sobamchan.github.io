# Background

One question I have about summarization research is that "Are there actually good use-cases for models we have been building?".


# Models we can have now

Here is a list of summarization datasets I have checked,

- CNN/DM
- XSum
- Gigaword
- NYT
- Newsroom
- Reddit TIFU
- SciTLDR

almost all of them are headline generation datasets for news article, and one TIFU has summaries of reddit posts in quite offensive language, and the last one is one-sentence summaries for ML papers.

There is another big field in summarization about legal documents but since I am not very familiar with the domain and progress there, I need to skip this topic, but will study on that and maybe later update this post.


# Thought experiments

Let's now imagine that we have systems that can achieve perfect ROUGE scores on existing summarization datasets.

How can we use these systems to improve our quality-of-life?

## Headline generation system applications

Perfect systems that can generate perfect headlines for news articles would not have impacts unless you work at the media company because almost all the articles come with headlines so there is no need to generate them.

Perhaps writers at news publishing companies would benefit from having such a system, to safe some time coming up with a headline for the written-article. I don't know expensive task it is but "mas que nada".

## Reddit TLDR generation system applications

I don't really follow Reddit but as far as I found in my quick investigation, not all the posts on this sub-reddit have summaries which would make a reason for users to generate summaries for them.
