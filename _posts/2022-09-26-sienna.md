# Loading jsonline files

Working on data with python, you need to load various kinds of files onto python processes.
One popular data format in machine learning is [**jsonline**](https://jsonlines.org/) in which each record is saved as json line by line.
A simple example looks like following,

```
{"Country": "Japan", "Capital": "Tokyo"}
{"Country": "France", "Capital": "Paris"}
```

.

If you want to load a file in this format, the most straightforward way wiht python would be read this file line by line, and load each line as json object like following,

```py
import json 
with open("./data.jsonl", "r") as f:
    data = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()]
```

and this way is absolutely fine, not complicated at all.

But when I was doing this over and over in projects, it's tiring.
So I did what most of the programmers would do, making a package for make this easeir, and give it a cool name.
This is why I wrote [sienna](https://github.com/sobamchan/sienna).

sienna doesn't have any extra dependencies (of course) so can be installed easily by pip (or my favorite package manager [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)) as following,

```
> pip install sienna
% or
> poetry add sienna
```

.

And after this, you can load jsonline files like,

```py
import sienna
data = sienna.load("./data.jsonl")
```

10x nicer, no?
It just saves one little line but it comes in handy when I want to load many files.

And you can easily save things too.

```py
import sienna
mega_cool_data = [
  {"Country": "Japan", "Capital": "Tokyo"},
  {"Country": "France", "Capital": "Paris"},
]
sienna.save(mega_cool_data, "./data.jsonl")
```


# Loading other file formats

Initially, I started this project to load only jsonline files but since I load json and text files quite often, I adapted sienna to them as well.

Given a path to a file you want to load, sienna automatically recognizes the file type and load it accordingly.

```py
import sienna
lines = sienna.load("./text_file.txt")  # As line separate strings
obj = sienna.load("./obj.json")  # As usual json file
objs = sienna.load("./objts.jsonl")  # As jsonline file
```

And of course, you can save python objects in those two formats.

```py
import sienna
sienna.save(["first line.", "second line."], "./text_file.txt")
sienna.save({"my": "data"}, "./data.json")
sienna.save([{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}], "./datas.jsonl")
```

Under the hood, sienna just checks its extension and match to super simple if blocks ([ref](https://github.com/sobamchan/sienna/blob/main/sienna/core.py#L5-L11)).
If it's neither `.json` nor `.jsonl`, sienna loads it as line separated text file.


# Conclusion

It's always fun to make mini packages with cool names.
If you have ideas to improve sienna, write an issue, or even a PR.

Happy coding.
