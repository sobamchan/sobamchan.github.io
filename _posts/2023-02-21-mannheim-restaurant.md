While there are quite a lot of restaurant options in this beautiful city of Mannheim, it's not trivial to spot truely good ones.
Although, I don't explore food aspect of life so much but I would like to share few good places I know in the city to ease the life of new coming Mannheimers.

I am just a Ph.D. student in the city without much budget for food my list of far from extensive, keep that in mind.

- [La Loba](https://goo.gl/maps/f7fjxFTuSXo9YS8N8)
  - Spanish Tapas bar
  - Wide selection for tapas and some wines, each dish/drink is affordable, high-quality.
- [Bori](https://goo.gl/maps/7kWmZX7kfWTgu45M7)
  - Korean restaurant
  - Small place, can be hard to find a table for more than 4 people
  - Bibimbap is my favorite dish there.
- [Pizzeria Papi](https://goo.gl/maps/6EBW2dhEvvrQ5HgF7)
  - Italian restaurant
  - Music is little too loud, not recommended if you want to discuss deep philosophical topics with your friends
  - Very good pizza, large portion, one pizza is enough to feed two Japanese people
