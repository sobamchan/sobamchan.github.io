# What is this?

This document is for a cool weekly event we have in our group, just to provide references/links to the tools I covered in the presentation.

I list here, the tools I used often for my work as a CS Ph.D. in terminal, whoever reads this post, needs to start using all of them.


# Why stay on CLI?

There are plenty of cool/useful/high-quality tools out there with real GUI, why keep using Terminal?

Just staying on keyboard makes you more productive?
Less CPU/memory consumption and high-performance?

No, it's just because (I think) it looks cooler.

So you don't miss almost anything real by not using any of the tools I list here, no need to change anything that you use now, just use what you like.


# Tools

## neovim

My main editor for prety much everything from note-taking to coding.
(I use VSCode for web app frontend developments just because I use a language which doesn't support neovim.)

Once you get used to it, and have proper plugins installed, you can move around and edit your codebase pretty fast.
I list plugins I can't live without below with very abstractive description.

- [nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
  - program parsing
- [ggandor/lightspeed.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/lightspeed.nvim)
  - jump around texts
- [TimUntersberger/neogit](https://github.com/TimUntersberger/neogit)
  - git stuff
- [nvim-neorg/neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg)
  - note-taking
- [nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
  - file finding


## zsh

I use [zim](https://zimfw.sh/) to manage plugins for few I have installed but nothing too much.

- [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)
  - tab completion

Mini hack for python developers.

```bash
py() {
    test -z "$1" && ipython --no-confirm-exit --ext=autoreload --quick \
        --InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines="['%autoreload 2']" \
        --no-banner|| command python "$@"
}
```


## CLI utilities

- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
  - better cd
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
  - better cat command
- [exa](https://the.exa.website/)
  - better ls

## pudb

python visual debugger runs on terminal [(link)](https://documen.tician.de/pudb/).
I don't use this for every debugging, but it comes in handy when working on a rather complex codebase.

# Things I don't do in Terminal

- Messaging
- Emails
- Paper writing (I use overleaf for a collaboration reason)
- Web browsing
- Calender
